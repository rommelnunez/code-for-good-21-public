# code-for-good-21-public
This is my public repo of the project that I created for JP Morgan's Code For Good Hackathon in the Fall of 2021. 
- You will find the website that shows our final project as a PDF.
- You can find the link to my team's presentation here: https://youtu.be/0PbN9LGpgZE
- To see the project in action, go to the `react-team-16-app` directory and run `npm start`. The app will load at `http://localhost:3000`.
